        <h3>The diamond ring</h3>
        <P>this movie helped me get a glimpse of the activities of the occultic groups in the 90's, also the 90's was the era with the most cultic dominance on campuses in west africa. the oau massacre took place in the 90's along with the other attacks of the cult groups on campuses. the movie depicted the activities of cult groups at their crescendo at the university of lagos Nigeria</P>
        <h3>Akeela and the bee</h3>
        <P>this movie made me feel the ability of one determination overcoming opposition as well as challenges that comes an individuals way.</p>
